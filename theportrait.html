    <h2>FAQ: </h2>
    <div class="question"> How do you solve this puzzle? </div>
    <div class="answer"> I don't want to provide the solution, as it would defeat the whole purpose of the game. 
    The puzzles are not very mathematical, you can figure them out with enough exploration.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">Is the game finished?</div>
    <div class="answer">I plan to add new things whenever I feel like it, but they will be small incremental updates.</div>
